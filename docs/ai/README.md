# AI

Although AI is built using software, it is mostly biology, psychology, mathematics, etc. As a result, AI researchers aren't excellent programmers. Since [Python](https://www.python.org/) is popular and easy to pickup, it has become the language of choice for implementing and using AI because of its unparalleled ecosystem. Everything from NLP tools such as [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) and [Ludwig](https://uber.github.io/ludwig/), to [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), uses Python. You also get great tooling (e.g., [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)).
