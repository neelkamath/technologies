# Technologies

![Cover](cover.jpg)

For developers who want to pick the best technologies to develop their project with, this repository suggests which tools to use. Unlike other comparisons, this repo explains the pros and cons of every major tech.

This will hopefully give you and me a better understanding at which technologies should be use for different projects. For niche use cases, you may obviously prefer different tech. Small, medium, and large project sizes refer to tens, hundreds, and thousands of lines of code respectively.

Here are the articles.
- [Programming Languages](programming_languages.md)
- [Tools](tools.md)
- [Web Frontends](web_frontends.md)
- [Mobile](mobile.md)
- [Backend](backend.md)
- [AI](ai.md)
